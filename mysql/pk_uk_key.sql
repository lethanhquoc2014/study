/*
KEY is the synonym for INDEX. You use the KEY when you want to create an index for a column or a set of columns 
that is not the part of a primary key or unique key.

A UNIQUE index ensures that values in a column must be unique. Unlike the PRIMARY index, 
MySQL allows NULL values in the UNIQUE index. In addition, a table can have multiple UNIQUE indexes.
